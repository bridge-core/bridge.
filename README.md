## About bridge.
bridge. is a powerful **add-on editor** designed to speed up your development. It can open all files inside a behavior pack (JavaScript, JSON and functions) and provides a **powerful work environment**.
Unleash the full power of add-ons with bridge. plugins and make use of rich auto-completions provided as you navigate through a file. **Creating Minecraft add-ons was never more convenient!**

## Why *you* should use bridge.
In general, dedicated add-on editors like bridge. have a few incredible advantages over normal text editors:
- You cannot write invalid JSON
- You cannot make general file structure mistakes because auto-completions guide you through the file
- You do not need to study vanilla files and/or the incorrect documentation to find out which arguments a component has
- Developing a behavior pack is significantly faster
Additionally, "bridge." has a few specific features which other editors do not offer:
- The ability to switch between auto-completions for multiple Minecraft versions seamlessly: We currently support v1.10 and v1.11 of Minecraft
- Packaging your behavior pack into a .mcpack file with only one click
- Support for plugins: From custom components to searching files - bridge. plugins can do almost anything
- bridge. interacts seamlessly with Minecraft and loads behavior packs from the com.mojang folder automatically

#### Auto-Completions
