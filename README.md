## About bridge.
bridge. is a powerful **add-on editor** designed to speed up your development. It provides a rich editing experience for all files inside behavior and resource packs (JavaScript, JSON and functions) and provides a **powerful work environment**.
Unleash the full power of add-ons with bridge. plugins and make use of rich auto-completions provided as you navigate through a file. **Creating Minecraft add-ons was never more convenient!**

## Why *you* should use bridge.
Most importantly, JSON editors like bridge. guarantee that you cannot write invalid JSON.
Additionally, "bridge." has a few more specific features which other editors do not offer:
- bridge. interacts seamlessly with Minecraft and loads behavior packs and the corresponding resource pack from the com.mojang folder automatically
- You cannot make general file structure mistakes because rich auto-completions guide you through the file
- You do not need to study vanilla files and/or the incorrect documentation to find out which arguments a component has
- Support for plugins: From custom components to searching files - bridge. plugins can do almost anything
- Developing is generally significantly faster

## Feature Overview
#### General
   - Create new behavior packs and resource packs with an automatically generated manifest.json
   - Create new behavior pack and resource pack files through a clear interface
   - Package your behavior pack with only one click
#### Editor
   - Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo, Redo and all other features you would expect
   - Powerful shortcuts to reorder and navigate through a JSON file
   - JSON displays as a tree structure with collapsible/expandable elements
   - Easily restructure JSON files by dragging elements
   - Beautiful syntax highlighting for all behavior pack files
   - Snippets to quickly import common JSON patterns
   - Error/Mistake detection and auto-fixes for some of them
   - bridge. file structure predictions for users who want to be even faster writing add-ons
#### Auto-Completions
   - Rich auto-completions for entities, loot tables, trades, spawn rules, biomes, items, blocks, recipes, features, feature rules, animations and animation controllers
   - Handcrafted: We don't trust the Minecraft documentation and you shouldn't either. That's why we wrote all suggestions by hand
   - Context sensitive: bridge. proposes different data depending on what you wrote before. Adding e.g. a new item results in the corresponding identifier being proposed whenever an item identifier is a valid value throughout your behavior and resource pack files.
   - Ability to switch between auto-completions for multiple Minecraft versions seamlessly: We always support the latest stable release and the latest beta
