# Plugin API

This is the documentation for bridge.'s new Plugin API. We are still working on bringing more and more capabilities to the new API.

### General

bridge. loads plugins per project. This means that every workspace can have an unique set of plugins. Plugins are a composition of JSON and JavaScript files.

### Getting Started

Navigate to the directory where bridge. stores your behavior packs. There is a button inside the explorer toolbar to open the folder. Choose the project to which you want to add a plugin and navigate to the `bridge/plugins` folder. If this folder does not exist yet, create a new one.

Inside this directory, you can create a new folder per plugin you want to add. Create a new JSON file in the root of your plugin called _manifest.json_ (`bridge/plugins/<PLUGIN NAME>/manifest.json`).

### Plugin Manifest

The plugin manifest stores important data on your add-on like its version number, the Script API version to use etc.

#### Example Manifest

```javascript
{
    "author": "solvedDev",
    "id": "aad1d7ec-a32e-4732-ad2b-abb770e38202",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "name": "My Plugin",
    "link": "www.my_homepage.com/me",
    "description": "My first bridge. plugin",
    "api_version": 1
}
```

-   Make sure to always **generate a new id** for all of your plugins. You can grab one from [here](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/).
-   You can omit the `api_version` attribute to always use the latest API version (_currently:_ `2`). We recommend to always specifically set it though.
-   The `link` attribute is optional and allows you to provide a link to an external webpage which appears in bridge.'s UI.

### Scripts

Scripts are loaded from the `<PLUGIN NAME>/scripts` folder. Scripts are written in JavaScript and allow plugins to deeply hook into bridge.'s functionality. You can add new dynamic auto-completions, create new windows, add support for new file types and do many more things.

### JavaScript API

We are currently working on creating the new API documentation.
